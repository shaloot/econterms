It allows administrators to provide clear labels and descriptions to data sets, making them easier to search and find. This saves valuable time and resources as it eliminates the need to manually review each data set and specify its contents. Additionally, it provides a way to intuitively search for certain data in a sea of information; tagging allows for specific searches and filters, instead of general terms. Security and privacy are also improved with the ability to tag data and specify access levels for certain sets of data. Overall, data tagging in Databricks brings unmatched convenience ",
