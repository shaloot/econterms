title: Homogenization
about: "Data homogenization refers to the process of standardizing or normalizing data to ensure consistency and uniformity across different sources, formats, or representations. The goal is to create a unified and standardized dataset, making it easier to analyze, compare, and integrate information from diverse origins. Data homogenization is particularly important in data integration, analytics, and business intelligence, where data may come from various systems, databases, or sources with differing structures and formats."
