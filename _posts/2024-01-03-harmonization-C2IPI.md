title: Harmonization
about: "Data Harmonization is the process of combining data from multiple sources and ensuring that it is consistent and compatible. Harmonization aims to create a unified view of data, regardless of its source, format, or structure. This process involves identifying similarities and differences between datasets and reconciling inconsistencies to avoid duplication and reduce redundancy. Data Harmonization is a crucial step in data integration, which allows organizations to make data-driven decisions and gain insights from their data."
