title: Deserialization
about: "Computer data is generally organized in data structures such as arrays, records, graphs, classes, or other configurations for efficiency. When data structures need to be stored or transmitted to another location, such as across a network, they need to go through a process called serialization. This process converts and changes the data organization into a linear format that is needed for storage or transmission across computing devices. The deserialization process from the linear data is the reverse, and causes the Address object to be instantiated in memory.."
