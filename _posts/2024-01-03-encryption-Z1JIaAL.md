title: Encryption
about: "Data encryption in data engineering refers to the process of converting plaintext data into a secure and unreadable format (ciphertext) using encryption algorithms. This practice is employed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or data breaches. In the context of data engineering, encryption is applied to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data as it is stored, processed, or transmitted."
