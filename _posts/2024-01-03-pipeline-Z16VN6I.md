title: Pipeline
about: "A data pipeline is a set of network connections and processing steps that moves data from a source system to a target location and transforms it for planned business uses. Data pipelines are commonly set up to deliver data to end users for analysis, but they can also feed data from one system to another as part of operational applications."
