title: Matching
about: "Data matching is the process of finding identical entries from one or more collections of data and unifying the data records. It could be performed between datasets to ensure that data from various datasets is synced. Matching examines the extent of overlap across all entries in a single data set and returns the weighted probability of a match for each pair of records matched. After that, you can pick whichever entries are matching and take measures on the underlying data."
