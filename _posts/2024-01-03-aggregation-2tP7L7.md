title: Aggregation
about: "Data aggregation is any process whereby data is gathered and expressed in a summary form. When data is aggregated, atomic data rows -- typically gathered from multiple sources -- are replaced with totals or summary statistics. Groups of observed aggregates are replaced with summary statistics based on those observations. Aggregate data is typically found in a data warehouse, as it can provide answers to analytical questions and also dramatically reduce the time to query large sets of data"
