title: Canonical Data Model
about: "A Canonical Data Model (CDM) is a standardized framework used to unify and streamline data integration among multiple systems within a business or organization. It serves as a common reference point and common language to bridge data inconsistencies and ensure seamless communication between different applications and databases. By simplifying data exchange and reducing data redundancy, the CDM enhances the efficiency, consistency, and maintainability of information systems."
