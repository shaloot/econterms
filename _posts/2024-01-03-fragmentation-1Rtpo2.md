title: Fragmentation
about: "Fragmentation is a process of dividing the whole or full database into various subtables or sub relations so that data can be stored in different systems. The small pieces or sub relations or subtables are called fragments. These fragments are called logical data units and are stored at various sites. It must be made sure that the fragments are such that they can be used to reconstruct the original relation (i.e, there isnâ€™t any loss of data).."
