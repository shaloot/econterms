title: Catalog
about: "A Data Catalog is a collection of metadata, combined with data management and search tools, that helps analysts and other data users to find the data that they need, serves as an inventory of available data, and provides information to evaluate fitness of data for intended uses.&newline;It is integral part of data management, searching, data inventory, and data evaluationâ€”as they all depend on the central capability to provide a collection of metadata."
