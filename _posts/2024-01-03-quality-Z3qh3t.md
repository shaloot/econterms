about: "Data quality is a measure of the condition of data based on factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability and whether it's up to date. Measuring data quality levels can help organizations identify data errors that need to be resolved and assess whether the data in their IT systems is fit to serve its intended purpose."
