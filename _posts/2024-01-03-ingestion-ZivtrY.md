title: Ingestion
about: "Data Ingestion is the process of obtaining, importing, and processing data for later use or storage in a database. This can be achieved manually, or automatically using a combination of software and hardware tools designed specifically for this task.&newline;Data can come from many different sources, and in many different formatsâ€”from structured databases to unstructured documents. These sources might include external data like social media feeds, internal data like logs or reports, or even real-time data feeds from IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The sheer variety of data sources and formats is what makes data ingestion such a complex process."
