title: Lifecycle
about: "Data lifecycle management (DLM) is an approach to managing data throughout its lifecycle, from data entry to data destruction. Data is separated into phases based on different criteria, and it moves through these stages as it completes different tasks or meets certain requirements. A good DLM process provides structure and organization to a businessâ€™s data, which in turn enables key goals within the process, such as data security and data availability."
