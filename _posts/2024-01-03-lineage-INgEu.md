title: Lineage
about: "All the data in an organization has a story; data lineage is about telling the story of that data as it travels through the various systems and platforms. So, data lineage is metadata over time, in that it reveals the “who, what, where, when, why, and how” of data. This course examines the core concepts of data lineage, including&colon; definitions, types of data lineage, why organizations need to be concerned about data lineage, important use cases, getting started, and more."
