about: "Data mesh is a cultural and organizational shift for data management focusing on federation technology that emphasizes the authority of localized data management. Data mesh is intended to enable easily accessible data by the business. Data assets are analyzed for usage patterns by subject matter experts, who determine data affinity, and then the data assets are organized as data domains. Domains are contextualized with business context descriptors. Subject matter experts use the patterns and domains to define and create data products. Data products are registered and made available for reuse relative to business needs."
