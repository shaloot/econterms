title: Denormalization
about: "Data denormalization is the process of restructuring a relational database by adding redundant data to one or more tables. The aim is to improve query performance by reducing the need for joins. The term refers to removing one or more normalization forms to achieve this goal. Normalization is a database design technique focused on minimizing data redundancy and inconsistency&newline;The idea behind data denormalization is that it is faster to fetch data from a single table than to join data from multiple tables. When dealing with large datasets, the performance boost can be significant. By denormalizing data, a company can optimize query performance and, as a result, enable faster data processing and analytics."
