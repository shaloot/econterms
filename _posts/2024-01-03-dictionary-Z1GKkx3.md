about: "A data dictionary is a centralized repository of metadata that provides a comprehensive description of the data used in a database, information system, or project. It serves as a reference for understanding the meaning, structure, relationships, and properties of the data elements within a database or dataset. The main purpose of a data dictionary is to ensure consistency, accuracy, and clarity in data management and interpretation."
