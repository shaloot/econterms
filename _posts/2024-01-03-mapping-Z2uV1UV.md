title: Mapping
about: "Data mapping is a vital process within data management that involves defining relationships between data elements and facilitating effective data integration, transformation, and analysis. This practice enhances data understanding, quality, and accessibility. It refers to creating a visual representation or structured documentation of how data from one source aligns with or corresponds to data from another source. It aids in understanding data flow, relationships, and transformations."
