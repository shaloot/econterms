title: Indexing
about: "Data indexing refers to the process of organizing and cataloging data so that it can be quickly retrieved and analyzed. This technique creates a sort of roadmap that lists the location of data on a disk, making it easier to access and retrieve specific data when necessary. It is an essential technique for managing large volumes of data and is particularly important when it comes to processing analytical queries."
