title: Normalization
about: "Database normalization is the process of structuring a database according to whatâ€™s called normal forms, with the final product being a relational database, free from data redundancy. More specifically, normalization involves organizing data based on assigned attributes as a part of a larger data model. The main objective of database normalization is to eliminate redundant data, minimize data modification errors, and simplify the query process."
