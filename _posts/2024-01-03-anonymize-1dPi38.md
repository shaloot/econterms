title: Anonymize
about: "Data anonymization seeks to protect private or sensitive data by deleting or encrypting personally identifiable information from a database. Data anonymization is done for the purpose of protecting an individual's or company's private activities while maintaining the integrity of the data gathered and shared. Data anonymization is also known as 'data obfuscation,' 'data masking,' or 'data de-identification.' It can be contrasted with de-anonymization, which are techniques used in data mining that attempt to re-identify encrypted or obscured information"
