title: Architecture
about: "Data architecture is a discipline that documents an organization's data assets, maps how data flows through its systems and provides a blueprint for managing data. The goal is to ensure that data is managed properly and meets business needs for information. While data architecture can support operational applications, it most prominently defines the underlying data environment for business intelligence (BI) and advanced analytics initiatives. Its output includes a multilayer framework for data platforms and data management tools, as well as specifications and standards for collecting, integrating, transforming and storing data."
