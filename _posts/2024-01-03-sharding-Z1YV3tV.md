title: Sharding
about: "Data Sharding, also known as horizontal partitioning, is a technique used to break down large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and together they form the complete dataset. This method allows for data to be distributed across multiple servers, improving performance and scalability."
