title: Serialization
about: "Data serialization is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects or dictionaries, into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream or JSON string. This is useful in modern data pipelines for tasks such as saving data to disk, transmitting data across a network, or storing data in a database."
