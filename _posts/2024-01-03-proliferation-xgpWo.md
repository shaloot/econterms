title: Proliferation
about: "'Data proliferation' is an umbrella term concerned with the large number of files and amount of data stored by entities such as governments and businesses. The massive amount of data coming in daily means these entities need more space and hardware, but data proliferation is moving faster than computer advancements as of 2011. It does not matter what type of information is stored â€” whether it is structured or unstructured; all that matters is that computer memory is being taken up. Storing all this data can be difficult, leading to extra costs. Another problem with data proliferation is that the network on which the data is stored and all associated programs tend to slow down."
