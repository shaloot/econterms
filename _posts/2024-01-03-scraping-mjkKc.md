title: Scraping
about: "Data Scraping refers to the process of extracting data from a website or another source, typically to transform and store it in a structured form. While the concept has existed for a long time, it's become increasingly relevant in the context of modern data engineering due to the vast amounts of data available on the web and the value that can be derived from analyzing that data."
