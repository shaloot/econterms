title: Shredding
about: "Data shredding, also known as data partitioning or data fragmentation, is the process of breaking down large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces for easier processing and analysis. Shredding data can improve performance by allowing distributed processing of the smaller pieces, which can be performed in parallel, reducing the amount of time required to process the entire dataset. This approach is particularly useful for large datasets that cannot be processed on a single machine or within a single process."
