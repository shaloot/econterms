title: Hashing
about: "Data hashing is a process that involves converting input data (or a 'message') into a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hash code or hash value. The primary purpose of data hashing is to create a unique digital fingerprint or signature for a given set of data. This process is widely used in various security and data integrity applications."
