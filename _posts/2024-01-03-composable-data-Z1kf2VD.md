title: Composable Data
about: "'Composable data' refers to the concept of making data components or elements modular and easily combinable to create flexible and dynamic datasets. The term draws inspiration from the idea of composability in software engineering, where software components are designed to be modular and easily combined to create diverse applications. In the context of data, composable data aims to provide a similar level of flexibility and agility in assembling and manipulating datasets for various purposes."
