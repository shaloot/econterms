title: Change Data Capture
about: "Change Data Capture (CDC) is a method for capturing and tracking changes made to data in real-time. It allows businesses to identify and capture every individual change made to the data, including inserts, updates, and deletes. CDC records these changes as events, providing an accurate and up-to-date representation of the data's evolution over time."
