title: Federation
about: "Data federation is a technology that virtually unifies data from different sources and makes it accessible under a uniform data model. The underlying data stores in a federated data store continue to operate autonomously. But data consumers can run federated queries as though the data were combined. This can be a significant advantage for organizations with many heterogeneous database types since users donâ€™t need to know the data language for each database to run a query."
