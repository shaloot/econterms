title: Munging
about: "The process of converting unstructured data into a structured format is typically referred to as 'data wrangling' or 'data munging'. Both terms refer to the process of transforming and mapping data from a raw form into another format that allows for more convenient consumption of the data.&newline;However, different people and organizations may use these terms in slightly different ways. For example, some people may use 'data munging' to specifically refer to the cleaning and preprocessing of data, while 'data wrangling' might be used in a broader sense to include tasks such as gathering and exploring the data."
