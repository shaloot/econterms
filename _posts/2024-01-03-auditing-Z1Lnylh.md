about: "Data auditing is the process of conducting a data audit to assess how company's data is fit for given purpose. This involves profiling the data and assessing the impact of poor quality data on the organization's performance and profits. It can include the determination of the clarity of the data sources and can be applied in the way banks and rating agencies perform due diligence with regard to the treatment of raw data given by firms, particularly the identification of faulty data"
