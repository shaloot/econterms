about: "Data mining is the process of analyzing hidden patterns of data according to different perspectives in order to turn that data into useful and often actionable information. Data is collected and assembled in common areas, such as data warehouses, and data mining algorithms look for patterns that businesses can use to make better decisions, such as decisions that help cut costs, increase revenue, or better serve customers or clients.&newline;Data mining is also known as data discovery or knowledge discovery. Itâ€™s critical in business intelligence to establish data-driven decisions."
