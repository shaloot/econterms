about: "Data Staging refers to the process of preparing and organizing data for further processing and analysis. It involves extracting raw data from various sources, transforming it into a consistent format, and loading it into a staging area or a data lakehouse environment such as Dremio. Data Staging acts as an intermediary step between data acquisition and data processing, ensuring data quality and compatibility."
