title: Virtualization
about: "Data virtualization is an umbrella term used to describe an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data. This can include how the data is formatted or where it is physically located. The goal of data virtualization is to create a single representation of data from multiple, disparate sources without having to copy or move the data."
